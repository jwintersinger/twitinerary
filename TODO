==========
Short term
==========
Get Satisfaction support
Migrate "Tweets about us" to backend (in memcache) -- better for SEO, since page will be changing
Store user object, other common datastore stuff in memcache
  Maybe just store user in session, which I believe is memcache-based

Fix notifier so that it is positioned from top of viewport -- right now, when document scrolled down, notifier may be missed as it always appears at top of document
Better handle multiple notifications in short span of time

Reset URL shortener & image uploader after Tweet submitted (close them if open)
Add "Tweets sent" counter for each user
Allow user to use his own bit.ly account (for link tracking, etc.)

Provide better indication of when last Tweet scheduled -- Alex schedules one, forgets when, doesn't know when to schedule next
  Solutions:
    Perhaps issue will go away when design implemented, for "next scheduled Tweet" will be much more prominent
    Rolling Tweets?
    Display multiple Tweets in "next scheduled Tweet"
    Move away from tab-based interface entirely -- perhaps scheduled Tweets should be visible at same time as "Schedule new Tweet"
    
Turn tags blue -- "#tweets"

Improve explanations:
  Don't fade out immediately -- allow user time to click on contained link, such as with "use TwitPic directly" link in image uploader password explanation
  Always position within visible client area -- don't make browser scroll
  Assign width via CSS

Bugs:
  Image uploader doesn't work in IE

OAuth: Add error detection/handling
Design:
  Finish all prose, other writing for app so that Alex may design to it
  Determine new name for application
  Favicon
  Bigger Tweet box -- too small in comparison with text


================
Before deploying
================
Allow access to / and /media URLs for non-admins


=========
Long term
=========
Support multiple Twitter accounts?
Show Tweets regarding application on homepage -- people who Tweet @account
Shorten URLs using user's bit.ly account rather than our own
Prevent user from scheduling more Tweets when too many, rather than notifying after schedule attempt
  Notify user of how many Tweets is too many when refused for excessive activity
"Rolling Tweets" -- have pool with no specific time, then post them every n minutes during certain time ranges
Go through Twitter app review process to increase API limits
