Edit support for Tweets:

  Set time on edit form to whatever Tweet's post_at time is, rather than default time

  Ensure contents of tab not reloaded when switching back to it, overwriting any changes made to content
  Disable "too many Tweets" check when saving edited Tweet

URL shortener: automatically append "http://" if not present

Don't allow Tweets posted in past
Indicate that times are in local timezone
Make URLs clickable on review Tweets
